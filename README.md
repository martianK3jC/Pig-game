# 🐷 Pig-game

A simple two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and score for that round. Players can choose to "Hold" their score to add it to their total. The first player to reach 50 points wins. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
