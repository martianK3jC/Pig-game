        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p id="game-rules">In this game, two players take turns rolling a die. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. 
        <br/>On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want, but if they roll a 1, they lose all points for that turn.
        <br/>If they roll any other number, they can choose to either keep the points or roll again.
        <br/>The first player to reach 100 points wins!</p>
